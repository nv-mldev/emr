A project plan for a standalone speech-to-report generation application for pediatric oncology, without direct EMR integration, can be structured in an .md file with Mermaid graphs. The focus will be on converting spoken clinical notes into a structured JSON and a formatted discharge summary.

-----

### 1\. Project Scope & Objective

The objective is to develop a web application that takes voice input from a clinician and generates a structured discharge summary. The application will leverage Google Cloud's APIs to transcribe the speech, extract medical entities, and format the data into a JSON output and a readable summary. This phase will focus *only* on the report generation, with EMR integration planned for a later phase.

-----

### 2\. Proposed Architecture

The architecture will be a two-part system: a frontend web application and a backend API server.

**a. Frontend (Web Application)**:

- A single-page application (SPA) to provide the user interface.
- It will include a button to start and stop voice recording.
- Real-time display of transcribed text to allow the user to follow along.
- A preview of the generated JSON and the final discharge summary report.

**b. Backend (API Server)**:

- A middleware server (e.g., using Node.js, Python Flask) to handle API requests.
- This server will manage the communication between the frontend and Google Cloud APIs.
- It will receive audio data, send it for transcription, and then process the resulting text.

-----

### 3\. Implementation Plan & Features

The development will be broken down into the following key features and steps:

**a. Speech-to-Text Transcription**:

- The frontend will record audio and stream it to the backend.
- The backend will send this audio data to Google Cloud's Speech-to-Text API.
- The transcribed text will be sent back to the frontend for real-time display.

**b. Medical Entity Extraction & Analysis**:

- The backend will use Google Cloud Healthcare API's **`projects.locations.datasets.fhirStores.executeBundle`** to parse the transcribed clinical text. This API can be used to extract structured data from unstructured clinical notes.
- The model will be trained or configured to recognize oncology-specific terms, such as:
  - [cite\_start]**Diagnoses**: `B ALL HR/ Induction`[cite: 18].
  - [cite\_start]**Medical Professionals**: `Dr Prasanth.V.R`[cite: 17].
  - [cite\_start]**Clinical Findings**: `febrile (100.3 F)`, `Crepitations present`[cite: 19, 23].
  - [cite\_start]**Lab Results**: `Hb9`, `Wbc 1000`, `Platelet 147000`[cite: 25].
  - [cite\_start]**Medications**: `Cefoperazone sulbactam`, `Oseltamivir`[cite: 41, 42].
  - [cite\_start]**Patient Demographics**: `Age: 7`, `Sex: F`[cite: 6, 7].

**c. JSON & Report Generation**:

- The extracted entities will be mapped to the JSON schema defined in the previous plan.
- A final discharge summary will be generated as a readable, formatted text or PDF, based on the JSON data. The format will mimic the provided document, including sections for `Patient details`, `History`, `Clinical Examination`, `Investigations`, and `Treatment`.

I want following fileds to be incorporated , that is output schema should be like this example

    participant B as Backend
    participant GC as Google Cloud

    C->>WA: Clicks "Start Recording"
    WA->>B: Streams audio
    B->>GC: Streams audio to Speech-to-Text
    GC-->>B: Sends transcribed text
    B->>WA: Displays real-time transcription
    C->>WA: Clicks "Stop Recording"
    WA->>B: Sends final audio data
    B->>GC: Sends text for Healthcare API (NLP)
    GC-->>B: Returns structured entities
    B->>B: Maps entities to JSON schema
    B->>WA: Sends JSON object & formatted report
    C->>WA: Reviews and saves the report
```

### 5\. Next Steps

- **Develop the UI**: Create a minimalist interface that is easy for clinicians to use.
- **Backend APIs**: Build the backend endpoints for handling audio streams and processing text.
- **Testing**: Test the accuracy of the transcription and entity extraction, especially with medical jargon.
- **Final Report Generation**: Implement the final formatting logic to convert the JSON data into a clean, professional-looking discharge summary.

### 6\. Software Stack

python full stack - go with flask.
